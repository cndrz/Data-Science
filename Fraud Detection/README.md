The primary purpose of this program is to identify fraudulent transactions within a dataset. By analyzing transaction data, the program aims to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities. This is crucial for financial institutions, e-commerce platforms, and any organization that processes transactions, as detecting fraud can prevent significant financial losses and protect customers.
Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Imbalanced-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
