		- Discovery

			- The Floppy Disk was originally property of the Soviet Union, containing launch codes for Soviet nuclear missiles reserved for use against an unspecified foreign power.
			- The CIA stole the Disk from a Soviet military base in the 1970s and brought it to the United States for analysts to decode. 
			- The Disk suddenly began causing things to start flying around itself, throwing hardware at the analyst team. 
			- A CIA informant notified the Federal Bureau of Control, and the Disk was requisitioned by Bureau agents the next day on March 11, 1974. 
			- The FBC experimented with the Floppy Disk and determined it to be an Object of Power, binding it to Bureau parautilitarians to test its telekinetic ability.

			- The containment location of the Floppy Disk is redacted in its documentation.
